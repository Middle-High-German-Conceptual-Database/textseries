mhdbdb textseries - Textreihentypologie (v. 0.1, 02/2023)
=====================================================================================

mhdbdb text series is an application-oriented thesaurus that can be used to classify and annotate resources in order to derive various benefits from them: For example, the indexing of sources, consideration in web user interfaces, the enrichment of bibliographic metadata/norm data and, last but not least, an expansion of the method inventory and improved contextualisation overall.

Let us make one thing clear: Nothing we publish here is set in stone. Everything is negotiable. More specifically, we explicitly ask the research community to collectively improve the beta version of our model. We appeal to demystify the development process of such a project and to make it collaborative, transparent and with the courage to use swarm intelligence and heuristics. Experts in the respective fields may contribute their knowledge to make this typology better for all. In this sense, we also ask - rather untypically for the current professional discourse - that criticism be packaged in constructive suggestions: What concrete changes would help to improve it?
